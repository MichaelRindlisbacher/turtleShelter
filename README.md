The main website is the user-facing side. We copied over a number of things from the original website to populate views.
All the public facing views are accesible through the navbar. A vests distributed tracker is found on the landing page.
The admin side of the site adds navigation to admin tools to the navbar when logged in.
The admin side requires a login, accessible by adding "login" to the URL (we did not add any external site links to login page because we didn't want an anonymous user to be able to get to the page), here is the URL:

LOGIN URL: https://turtleshelter2-3.is404.net/login

SUPER ADMIN USER: ADMIN    
SUPER ADMIN PASSWORD: PASSWORD      
The super admin has permission to add, edit, and delete users, as well as all the permissions of a regular admin.

TA USER (regular admin): GRADER     
TA PASSWORD: PASSWORD123      
Regular admins have permission to add, edit, and delete both events and volunteers.

When logged in, you will see an "ADMIN TOOLS" dropdown menu in the navbar. This can be used to get to all the applicable admin pages. 
You will also see a logout button, which will redirect you to the login page and remove admin priveleges from the session.
